## Getting Started

Outside of this repo, you can start a new project with this template using [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/) (the `create-cloudflare` CLI):

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=cloudflare/templates/astro-blog-starter-template
```

A live public deployment of this template is available at [https://astro-blog-starter-template.templates.workers.dev](https://astro-blog-starter-template.templates.workers.dev)

## üöÄ Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.


## PROMPT

Goal
Build a date-sorted table of upcoming shows in the Montreal region (Montreal + Laval) filtered to my tastes.

Time window
- Start: when you run this (use America/Toronto local date/time).
- End: +6 months from start.
- Do NOT hardcode dates.

Sources (official only; no third-party aggregators)
- MTELUS, Beanfield Theatre, Club Soda, Le National, Foufounes √âlectriques, L‚ÄôOlympia, Th√©√¢tre Fairmount, Bell Centre / Place Bell
- Promoters: evenko, Extensive Enterprise
Requirement: Visit each official site page. If a show isn‚Äôt on an official listing, exclude it.

Data to collect (per event)
- date_time_iso (ISO 8601 with local timezone)
- date_display (e.g., ‚ÄúAug 27, 2025‚Äù)
- artists (array; parse titles like ‚ÄúX with Y / support Z‚Äù into separate names)
- headliner (string)
- venue (exact)
- city (Montreal or Laval)
- genre_raw (as listed)
- url (canonical event URL from the venue/promoter)
- blurb_raw (if available)

Normalization
- Deduplicate the same event across venue/promoter (same headliner + date + venue). Keep the venue page as canonical url when possible.
- Map genre_raw to one curated style label (see ‚ÄúStyle mapping‚Äù).
- Exclude past or cancelled events.

Taste filter (keep MOST shows but remove obvious mismatches)
Keep if it fits any bucket below; remove only if clearly off-base:
- Rock/Metal core: classic rock 60s‚Äì90s; NWOBHM; doom/gothic; prog/alt; grunge; modern heavy (Ghost, Mastodon, Sleep Token, Spiritbox).
- Songwriters: Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell (and kindred).
- Americana/outlaw: e.g., Willie Nelson lineage.
- Indie/art rock: Radiohead, The National.
- Ambient/experimental: Brian Eno lineage.
- Jazz innovators: Miles, Coltrane lineage (modern innovators welcome).
- Scores/OST: John Williams, Howard Shore, select game OSTs.
- Qu√©bec-forward: proud of local scene (Harmonium, Offenbach, Jean Leloup, + Cohen/Joni/Neil/Rush).
Avoid: hype-cycle algorithmic pop, plastic EDM, ‚Äúcontent farm‚Äù acts.

Style mapping (choose one label)
- Classic rock ‚Ä¢ NWOBHM ‚Ä¢ Doom/Gothic ‚Ä¢ Prog/Alt ‚Ä¢ Grunge ‚Ä¢ Modern heavy ‚Ä¢ Songwriter ‚Ä¢ Americana/Outlaw ‚Ä¢ Indie/Art rock ‚Ä¢ Ambient/Experimental ‚Ä¢ Jazz (innovator) ‚Ä¢ OST/Score ‚Ä¢ Qu√©bec iconic ‚Ä¢ Other-rock (only if none above fits)

Output
1) Produce HTML table ROWS ONLY (no header, no surrounding table) sorted ascending by date_time_iso. Each row must follow EXACTLY:
<tr>
  <td>{date_display}</td>
  <td>{artists joined with " + "}</td>
  <td>{venue}</td>
  <td>{style}</td>
  <td>{analysis}</td>
  <td><a href="{url}">link</a></td>
  <td>{album_suggestion}</td>
</tr>

2) Constraints for fields:
- date_display: ‚ÄúMMM DD, YYYY‚Äù (English month abbreviations).
- analysis: 6‚Äì12 words, crisp, no fluff; describe vibe (e.g., ‚ÄúAngsty shimmer with hooks‚Äîsad kids, loud hearts.‚Äù).
- album_suggestion: 1 seminal album to prep for the headliner (prefer a widely regarded classic; if new act, suggest their strongest or latest LP).
- style: exactly one from Style mapping.
- url: required; if missing, DO NOT include the event.

Quality & honesty rules
- Cite only events you found on official sources above. No guesses, no placeholders.
- If an artist matches only weakly, keep it (erring on inclusion) unless it‚Äôs clearly off-base per ‚ÄúAvoid‚Äù.
- If unsure about genre, infer from the artist‚Äôs best-known work, then choose the closest single style.
- If multiple nights, include each date as a separate row.

Example rows (format reference only; do not fabricate these):
<tr>
  <td>Aug 27, 2025</td>
  <td>Thousand Below + Aviana + True North + Dreamwake</td>
  <td>Th√©√¢tre Fairmount</td>
  <td>Modern heavy</td>
  <td>Angsty shimmer with hooks‚Äîsad kids, loud hearts.</td>
  <td><a href="https://example.com">link</a></td>
  <td>Thousand Below ‚Äî Gone In Your Wake</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Aug 30, 2025</td>
  <td>Descendents + Buzzcocks + MattstaGraham</td>
  <td>MTELUS</td>
  <td>Other-rock</td>
  <td>Eternal caffeine; melody at 200 bpm.</td>
  <td><a href="https://example.com">link</a></td>
  <td>Descendents ‚Äî Milo Goes to College</td>
</tr>

Final deliverable
- Output ONLY the <tr>‚Ä¶</tr> rows, ready to paste into my table.
